This is the code for HW1 of EECE5644.
The code was written by Alex Yeh and functions from the following libraries were used:
numpy, pandas, torch, sklearn, skipy, matplotlib

All scripts should be called at the Question-folder level.

To run the code from Question 1 or Question 2, first run the sampleGenerator script to create the sample files.
The scripts from Question 1 should be run in the order erm1_a, erm1_b, erm1_c so the ROC curves can be compared properly.
The scripts from Question 2 should be run by calling erm2_b.
